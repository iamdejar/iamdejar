### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kirill Matveev, a Frontend developer, mainly working with React and TypeScript.

My profile contains two small projects on React, which I created as a test task for interviews:

- [Readers Club](https://github.com/iamdejar/reading-club-react-app/) is an application using React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, SCSS and CSS Modules. Implemented requests to the JSON Server and display of the list of club members in the interface. I also created an admin authorization form (it only checks whether the inputs are filled in), after authorization the features of deleting and editing club member cards become available.
- [Todo List](https://github.com/iamdejar/todo-list-react/) is a simple React application using React, JavaScript, Redux Toolkit, SCSS and CSS Modules. Here I have implemented a classic set of Ð¡RUD features, also data is synchronized with Local Storage.

I am currently studying the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js) stack and writing a full-stack application. I hope to be able to make it publicly available soon. âš¡

Open to communication and any kind of cooperation: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iamdejar/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamdejar/) :)
